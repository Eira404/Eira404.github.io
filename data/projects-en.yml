  description: This project implements a rhythm game on the web. It was developed as part of the 2023 Frontend Development Training Course Design at Nankai University. It is solely for self-learning and will not be commercialized. Features of this version include registration, login, adding friends, partner selection, music pack selection, song selection, automated machine play, potential value calculation, fragment calculation, etc. Player gameplay is not currently supported. The logic judgment code has been completed but not yet integrated into this version.
  notes: The audio, images, fonts, and designs used in this project are unpacked from the Arcaea game. I do not own any of these assets. All copyrights for the audio, images, and fonts belong to lowiro or other companies. Only the code is self-written. If this project infringes on your rights, please contact me for removal.

  description: A simple frontend text renderer developed with Vue3. Users provide articles, and the frontend handles the rendering. The syntax is similar to Markdown, so writing articles requires almost no HTML code. It supports multiple template syntaxes, offering users a simple and elegant text renderer.
  notes: A Software Engineering course project, created to experience software engineering practices and to try applying compiler principles for article parsing (eventually abandoned QAQ — after finishing, I checked markdown-it source code and realized I overcomplicated things). Later, I switched to writing markdown-it plugins instead (fun and addictive).
